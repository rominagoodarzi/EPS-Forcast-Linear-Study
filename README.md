# EPS Forcast Linear Study

Hi everyone!
I’ve completed my data analysis task, which involves answering the question: **Are analysts’ annual forecast updates a linear function of their quarterly forecast errors?**
My solution is provided in the Jupyter Notebook (solution.ipynb). Now, I’m looking for collaborators to review, improve, and correct my code and methods.

## Project Background
This project analyzes two datasets (fundq and det_epsus) to explore the relationship between analysts’ forecast updates and their forecast errors. Key steps include:
- Merging datasets and creating derived variables.
- Performing descriptive analysis with tables and visualizations.
- Conducting regression analysis to test the hypothesis.
  
## What I Need
I’m seeking feedback to:
- **Improve Code Quality:** Optimize code structure, efficiency, and readability.
- **Suggest Enhancements:** Propose additional methods, controls, or visualizations to strengthen the analysis.
  
## How to Contribute
- **Review My Notebook:** Check the solution.ipynb file for any issues, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement.
- **Propose Changes:** Submit your suggestions by opening a Pull Request or creating an Issue.
- **Explain Your Changes:** Include brief explanations of your corrections or enhancements.

## Thank You!
Your feedback is invaluable, and I’m grateful for your time and expertise.
